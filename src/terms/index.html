					<p>These VQ Labs Terms of Use (this „Agreement”) are entered by VQ Labs and you as an individual or, if you execute this Agreement on behalf of a legal entity, that entity (the “Customer”). This Agreement governs the Customer’s use of the VQ Labs service - „VQ Marketplace“ - that enables you to setup a hosted online marketplace (the „Service“).</p>

					<p>BY USING THE SERVICE IN ANY WAY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED AND ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND, IF YOU HAVE INDICATED THAT YOU ACT ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACT ON BEHALF OF SUCH ENTITY.</p>

					<p>If You do not understand or wish to be bound by this Agreement, please do not use, access or register with the Service. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT REMOVES OR SUPERSEDES YOUR RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER BASED ON APPLICABLE MANDATORY PROVISIONS OF LAW.</p>

					<h2>1. Service</h2>

					<p><b>1.1. Marketplace</b></p>

					<p>You can use the Service („VQ Marketplace“) to setup your own online marketplace subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and possible policies posted on the website of the Service at vq-labs.com. The Service will be hosted by VQ Marketplace in its own dedicated internet address (agreed separately with You).</p>

					<p>You are solely responsible and liable for the Marketplace and any business and activities carried out on the Marketplace. Between You and VQ Labs, You are responsible for the transactions carried out on the Marketplace. Without limiting the foregoing, You are responsible for operating the Marketplace in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and for posting such Terms of Use, Terms of Sale and other terms and policies (together the “Marketplace Terms”)on the Marketplace as may be required by applicable laws, rules and regulations. You are responsible for ensuring that, unless and to the extent dictated by mandatory provisions of applicable law, the Marketplace Terms are not in violation of the provisions of this Agreement. VQ Labs and You are independent contractors and You have no authority to give or make any guarantees or representations on behalf of VQ Labs to any party.</p>

					<p><b>1.2. Changes to the Service</b></p>

					<p>The Service is based on the VQ Labs open source software platform and will be evolving as the platform gets updated. VQ Labs is entitled to change the Service or its part at any time. VQ Labs shall make its best efforts to inform you in advance of material changes adversarially affecting your use of the Service. If you do not wish to use the changed Service, you may terminate your use of the Service and this Agreement effective as of the date on which the changes would take effect by informing VQ Labs of such termination prior the date.</p>

					<h2>2. Marketplace Content and Information</h2>

					<p><b>2.1. Content</b></p>

					<p>Between the Parties and subject to the rights of the users of Your Marketplace, You retain the title and all right to all text, pictures and other content (the “Content”) You or the users of Your Marketplace create in or submit to the Service. You are solely responsible for the Content. You acknowledge that the content is controlled by you or other users who have created or submitted the Content, and they are not created, submitted or controlled by VQ Labs. VQ Labs is merely providing a platform enabling You to setup and operate the Marketplace and its Contents. You permit VQ Labs and other users to use the Content to provide the Service and otherwise in accordance with the nature of the Service.</p>

					<p>The role of VQ Labs in respect to the Marketplace and Content is that of a hosting service provider pursuant to the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on Electronic Commerce. You agree that VQ Labs may disable Your Service or its part following VQ Labs’ receipt of a takedown notice or for any other reason.</p>

					<p><b>2.2. Privacy</b></p>

					<p>As the operator of the Marketplace, You are responsible for ensuring that the personal data relating to the users of the Marketplace is collected and processed in accordance with applicable laws. If European Union privacy regulation is applicable to the collection and processing of such data, you are deemed to be the data controller with respect to such data. Where required under applicable laws, You have to post Privacy Policy or similar document to the Marketplace to disclose the details of Your collection and processing of personal data.</p>

					<p>As a Service platform provider, VQ Labs processes and stores end user personal data on your behalf. VQ Labs will abide by the applicable German and European Union regulation when performing such tasks. For more information on how VQ Labs processes end user personal data, please see the <a href=“/privacy”>VQ Labs Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

					<h2>3. Fees and Payment Terms</h2>

					<p>VQ Labs may charge You the mutually agreed fees for the use of the Service. If any fees are chargeable for the Service, they shall be charged from You monthly or at other mutually agreed intervals.</p>

					<p>Unless and to the extent expressly indicated otherwise, listed fees and any amounts payable are net amounts exclusive of possibly applicable VAT, sales tax, or any other applicable taxes and charges imposed by any government entity in connection with Your use of the Service. You are liable for any such taxes and charges.</p>

					<p>If a payment is late from its due date, the Service Provider has a right to suspend the provision of the Service temporarily until the payment is made.</p>

					<p>VQ Labs reserves the right to change pricing when needed. VQ Labs shall notify You of a change in the fees charged for the Service at least 60 days in advance and You should wish not to accept the change in fees, You can terminate this Agreement to end in accordance with Section 8.1 below.</p>

					<h2>4. Service Level Guarantee</h2>

					<p>VQ Labs will make all reasonable efforts to keep the Service available 24/7 with an uptime percentage as high as possible.

					<p>Service Availability during the Calendar Month and Service Credit as % of the Monthly Fee<br>
					 &lt;95%  10%<br>
					 &lt;93%  25%<br>

					<p>VQ Labs will deduct the Service Credit from Your next invoice regarding monthly or annual fees charged the Service. Service Credits are not paid out as refunds or other such amounts.</p>

					<p>The compensation affects only the monthly fee, not any transaction commissions or other forms of payments paid to the Service Provider.<br>

					When calculating the monthly availability an outage does not count if it is caused by any of the following:</p>

					<p>Factors outside of VQ Labs’ reasonable control, including any force majeure events;
					any reason attributable to any third party used in provision or in connection to providing the service, e.g. payment gateways, hosting providers, name server provider etc.;
